## About

The Scottish Ruby User Group is a collection of people who are linked
with Scotland and have an interest in [Ruby][] and [Ruby on Rails][].
We meet every month in [Glasgow](#glasgow) and [Edinburgh](#edinburgh)
for presentations from members and guests, and a chat about Ruby and
related subjects.  All are welcome, and there are no subscriptions or
costs involved.

Meetings are announced in advance on the [mailing list][] and
[Open Tech Calendar][], and follow our [code of conduct].

## Edinburgh

We meet in Edinburgh on the third Thursday of the month at 19:30
onwards.  While [FreeAgent][] are busy moving offices, meetings are
currently at [CodeBase][], in Argyle House on the corner of
[West Port and Lady Lawson Street][].  Head to floor M (top floor) and
you will be directed to the meeting.
