## About

The Scottish Ruby User Group is a collection of people who are linked
with Scotland and have an interest in [Ruby][] and [Ruby on Rails][].

We meet every month online and in person in [Edinburgh](#edinburgh)
for presentations from members and guests, and a chat about Ruby and
related subjects. 

All are welcome, and there are no subscriptions or
costs involved.

Meetings are announced in advance on the [mailing list][], [Meetup][], and [Google Group][] and follow our [code of conduct].

You can also find us on:
