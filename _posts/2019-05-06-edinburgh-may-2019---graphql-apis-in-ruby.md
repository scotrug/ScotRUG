title: Edinburgh, 9th May 2019 - GraphQL APIs in Ruby
---


### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in May will be in different venue to usual. <a href="https://freeagent.com">FreeAgent</a> have offered to host us on Thursday the 9th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1947292751">their Edinburgh offices on Fountainbridge</a>.

When you arrive there will be small A4 signs printed up around the door, and someone waiting for you in reception who can let you up to the right floor. If you arrive before 18:00 and no one is around, wait a minute or two and someone will come and get you. Otherwise contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

## *What?*
The North wind is blowing, and it's making May cold. As the traditional early Edinburgh summer is delayed somewhat, other events continue apace. Tradfest comes to an end, whilst Imaginate Festival starts up. All exploring the mix of tradition and imagination that marks creativity.

In the last month, we've had two large annual Ruby conferences take place, with plenty of excitement. The first was [RubyKaigi](https://rubykaigi.org/2019) in Fukuoka, with exciting announcements on [Sorbet](https://sorbet.org/) and Ruby 3. The second was [RailsConf](https://www.railsconf.com/), where for the first time in a while the new Rails version wasn't quite announced.

However, individual talks from neither of those events are unavailable so instead we're going to be showing a talk from last year's RailsConf, on using GraphQL in Ruby to power an API. Let's watch someone outline another tool to have in your Ruby toolbelt, and then discuss it afterwards.

As always, ScotRUG meetings are welcoming to all comers, first timers or regular attendees, new to the language or not. See you there then? Wonderful.
