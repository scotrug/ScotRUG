Head over to the CCA Saramago Café on **Thursday 3 March** at **18:30** for a
drink and a chat about Ruby, Rails and web development.

There’ll be the usual [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org) discussion, we’ll
take a look at some of the new stuff coming up in
[Rails 5](http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2016/2/27/Rails-5-0-beta3/), and this
month we’ll also have a go at tackling a few problems from the
[exercism.io Ruby track](http://exercism.io/languages/ruby), so bring a laptop
if you like.

Get in touch with David on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kotoshenya), [Meetup][]
or by [email](mailto:david@djones.eu?subject=ScotRUG March Glasgow Meetup) with
any questions, or if you need directions to the venue. There is more information
and maps on the [Meetup][] and
[OpenTechCalendar](https://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3616-glasgow-ruby-group)
event pages.

See you there!
