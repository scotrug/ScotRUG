title: Edinburgh, 11th August 2016 - Code Kata
---


### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in August will kick off in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> at the by now banal time of 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">Codebase's shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>. The entrance on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street is no longer in use, so head around to the other side of the building where you'll find the glass doors emblazoned with "Codebase".

Our room hasn't been confirmed yet. However, there will be folk in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*
It's August, so the festivals will be in full swing. So much music, theatre, circus, comedy and spoken word in one place! It's also that time in the four year cycle when the Olympics are on. In homage to both these events, we thought it was time for another code kata. A [code kata](http://codekata.com/) is a small contained programming problem. The idea is that once you've finished it, you can try and solve it over and over again, with your familiarity with the problem allowing you to experiment with different approaches.

We last undertook a kata [in May](/2016/05/08/edinburgh-may-2016.html), counting lines of Java code. If you've got solutions to this you've had a play with in the meantime, bring them along! If you haven't that's good too!

We'll be trying something different this month, and as always it should be beginner friendly. We look forward to seeing you there!
