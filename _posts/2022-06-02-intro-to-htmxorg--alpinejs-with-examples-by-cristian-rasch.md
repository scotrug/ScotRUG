title: Intro to htmx.org & alpine.js with examples, by Cristian Rasch
---

## *When and Where*
We'll meet on the second Thursday of the month at 18:00 on Thursday, June 9th. Since we're meeting virtually, we'll send out the link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/286037542/) closer to the time.

## *What*
Cristian Rasch is coming to show off the virtues of combining a couple of modern, declarative JS libraries to help build a simpler front end.

We've had talks on similar themes on Stimulus JS and Hotwire over time. It'll be wonderful to understand other alternatives!
