## *Where and When?*
This January, we will be back in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 9th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

## *What?*
It's a new decade! In the mix of the tradition of end of year lists, we've also been encountering plenty of end of decade lists. What was your favourite single? Movie? Ruby release? ScotRUG event?

Well, one of my favourite ScotRUG events of the last few years was a workshop we ran about <a href="https://stimulusjs.org/">Stimulus JS</a>, the modest JavaScript framework that now ships with Rails. Now a few years later, Chris Green is going to talk to us a bit more about the framework, now that he's had the chance to use it in production at FreeAgent.

As per usual, folks both new and old are welcomed along! We look forward to seeing you on Thursday.
