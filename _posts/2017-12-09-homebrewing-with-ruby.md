title: Edinburgh 14th December - Homebrew Managing Your Mac with Ruby with Alyssa Ross
---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in December will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 14th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*
Ice rinks, mulled wine, sub-zero temperatures and gaudy lights. Winter conjures flashes of memories, and promises to lay down new ones as midwinter approaches. Reflections, refractions, plans and dreams.

[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) is a package manager for macOS. It was born of the dream to easily manage the software that Apple didn't provide in an extensible and maintainable way. Over the course of the life of the project it has be come the de facto way for software developers using MacOS to do this. It is also almost entirely written in Ruby.

Have you ever wanted to know what it's like writing command line applications in Ruby? Or what it's like to work on a popular open source project? Or how to get involved in such an endeavour? Alyssa Ross is one of the core maintainers of Homebrew, and lives right here in Edinburgh. We're lucky enough to have her come speak to us about Homebrew and I'm sure will be happy to take questions at the end.

We'll supply some snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner, and CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly bunch of humans and newcomers are most welcome! See you there then? Smashing.
