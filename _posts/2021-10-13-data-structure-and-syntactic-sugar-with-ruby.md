title: Data structures and syntactic sugar with Ruby
---

## *Where and When?*
We unfortunately had to cancel last month's meetup at the last minute, but are back again this month. Details are largely the same, only the date is different! So: we'll meet online, on the second Thursday of the month at 18:00. Time to have a wee break if you're working, meet your virtual friends . So: that's the 14th of October at 18:00. Since we're meeting virtually, we've sent out the link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/mljltlyccnbsb/).


## *What?*
As we said last month: We will be talking about data structures. How do they (most commonly) work under the hood conceptually and why you would use one over the other? How do we use them in Ruby and what syntactic sugar do we have to access data from those data structures?

The good thing when we talk about data structures is you don't have to be an expert with a specific language! We will talk about the general idea behind them and see how they work in Ruby. If this sounds fun, come along and learn together.
