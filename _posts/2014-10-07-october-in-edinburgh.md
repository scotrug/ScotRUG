title: 16th October Edinburgh Meetup
---

It's going to be an interesting meetup with two speakers so far.

__Pets, Cattle and Cloned Sheep__

[John Daniels](https://twitter.com/semanticist) will be giving a lightning talk version of **["Pets, Cattle and Cloned Sheep"](http://container.camp/talks/pets_cattle_cloned_sheep/)** about Docker.

There was alot of discussion about virtualisation at the last meetup, which trickled onto the mailing list, so it'll be great to hear more about Docker.

At this point you're probably thinking "Docker sounds really useful, but who in their right mind would trust me to use it?". Well...

__"WHAT'S THE WORST THAT CAN HAPPEN?" - Enabling authentic trust at work__

[Marc Burgauer](https://twitter.com/somesheep) will be talking about trust:

_Teaser_

Trust is the metric that best reflects the quality of our relationships and of our social connections. Without trust, organisational improvements efforts cannot flourish. We reliably find the absence of trust is the cause for teams failing to adopt agile or lean practices successfully. How can trust be developed to support successful adoption?

We're physically hardwired for connection. Rejection hurts. We get meaning and validation where connection allows us to be authentic. Yet we exist in environments that routinely inform us, that what we do and who we are, is not "Good Enough". We are shamed into conformity (often masqueraded as improvement) and blamed for failures.

"Management, in most of its incarnations, is an institutionalized form of distrust" say Robert Solomon and Fernando Flores.

This talk explores how we can remain authentic in a blame culture; how we can build authentic trust and enable safe-to-fail environments to strengthen our connections, as well as my own experience applying these practices.

_Bio_

It's Marc's first time at ScotRUG Edinburgh, so here's an ice-breaker:

Marc Burgauer has experienced professional life as a biologist, an award-winning performance artist and musician, enterprise database architect and early web applications programmer, founder, board member and manager in multiple startups, project manager and coach in multinationals and public services.

Complexity theory defined Marc's worldview early in life. He quotes Erich Jantsch's “The Self-organizing Universe” as the pivotal book that he read as a teenager. Marc’s interest in theories about work, including his acclaim of Peter Drucker, was re-ignited when he first adopted XP in 1999.

For the last 15 years, Marc has been keen to test ideas and, as a practitioner, enjoys the application of theories in day-to-day work.

Marc currently focuses his studies on innovation and cultural change while, as a consultant, he encourages organizations to adopt lean and agile practices.

__New to ScotRUG?__

ScotRUG is an informal meetup. Different people tend to turn up each month, both regular attendees and new people.

Some people have done alot of Ruby and some people are just curious. If you fall into any of these groups, just come along!

The meeting usually wraps up about 9pm, although sometimes some people head to a nearby tavern afterwards to continue the discussion.
