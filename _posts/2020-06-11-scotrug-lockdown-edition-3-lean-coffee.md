title: ScotRUG Lockdown Edition (3) 11th June - Lean Coffee
---

### *Where and When?*
Like last month, we'll be meeting up online. It'll be Thursday June the 11th, at 18:00. We'll be using Google Meet for this meetup. We'll send out the link via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/mljltlybcjbpb/) on the day itself. So sign up there!

## *What?*
We entered phase 1 of the lockdown ease. Have any of you meet with friends in parks, enjoying the sunshine ? If meeting friends outside in the park is not your thing (like me) then perhaps meeting with us online from the comfort of your house sounds better ?
Well, it may just be your lucky day! ScotRUG will meet again online and this month we will have a Lean Coffee!

Bring 3 topics (or more?) you would like to discuss and everyone will vote for their favourites. We will then start discussing about those topics starting with the most voted one.


See some (all?) of you on Thursday!
