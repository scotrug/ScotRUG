### *What*

Over the last year, Cristian has been experimenting with alternative frontend web programming stacks to use with 
Rails.
Many people already know about Turbo, so instead he'd like to talk a bit about a couple classic libraries that work 
really well together: htmx and Alpine.
He'll also give us a high-level overview of what Inertia.js is and what it allows you to do.

### *Who*

Cristian Rash is a software engineer with over 15 years experience who specialises on Ruby, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, 
Redis and Linux.
He is co-founder and has been part of the Argentinian [WeCode](https://wecode.io/en/) community for the past 9 years.
