Come along to Saramago in [the CCA](https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=350+Sauchiehall+Street%2C+Glasgow%2C+gb) at **18:30 on Thursday 5 May**, for questions and chat about writing software in Ruby. We will be at a table in the upstairs bar like last month (not the caf√© downstairs, where we've been previously.)

This may be the last Glasgow meetup for a while as [David](https://twitter.com/kotoshenya) will be away at the beginning of June, and possibly beyond. If you (yes, you!) want to keep the meetup going, [drop me a message](mailto:david+scotrug@djones.eu?subject=Glasgow Ruby meetup) and I'll set you up with everything you need as an organizer.
