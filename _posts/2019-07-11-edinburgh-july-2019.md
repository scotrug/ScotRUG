When you arrive someone waiting for you in reception who can let you up to the right floor. If you arrive before 18:00 and no one is around, wait a minute or two and someone will come and get you. Otherwise contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

## *What?*
Summer's here! The rain is falling and the temperature is up at a giddying 18 degrees. Tourists are filling the streets, shops and restaurants and you can hear the city gearing up for the Summer Festivals. Those seats by the castle are looking more solid by the day.

In the last few months we've watched a few talks from various conferences, so this month we're going to dive back into an activity we haven't touched in years: [code reading](http://www.readingcodegood.com/)! There's much to be learned by diving into a small Ruby class; last time we did this we had a look at the OpenStruct code in Ruby's standard library. We have a few suggestions lined up, but if you've got a small, open source, Ruby project in mind that you'd like to dive into, feel free to come along to the meetup and suggest it.

ScotRUG welcomes first timers and regular attendees, whether you're new to the language or not. We'd love to see you there!
