### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in May will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 10th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

May, along with September, tends to be a cloud light, summerlike wonderland in Edinburgh. Warm out of the wind, long bright days and delicious spring vegetables all scross the piece. We've had two Ruby conferences in the UK so far this year, with one more to come: Brighton Ruby! Tickets <a href="https://brightonruby.com">are available</a>.

This month, <a href="https://twitter.com/afcapel">Alberto Fernández-Capel</a> is coming to talk to us about "Economics and Software Development". As economics is the study of how people produce and consume goods and services, from food to art, it's a great lens to study what we do.

We'll supply some snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner, and stave off the cold. CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly group of humans, and as always newcomers and old timers are equally welcome.
