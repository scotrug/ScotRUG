~~There'll be a Lean Coffee session at CodeBase~~

~~As usual, we’ll kick off in CodeBase at 19:30. That’s in Argyle House on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street. Head up to Floor L and we’ll be in the Nor' Loch room.~~

### _Update_

*Venue change*: 19:30 at the [Beehive Inn](https://goo.gl/maps/1RqL156d9Rn) on Grassmarket. We will tweet photos of our exact location and faces on the [ScotRUG Twitter](https://twitter.com/scotrug).
