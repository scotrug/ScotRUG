title: Edinburgh March Meeting (Thursday 17th) - More Ruby Koans
---

Following on from the success of last month's Koan's meeting, we're extending it to March. The plan is to run through some more Koans, and also look out for Ruby 2.0+ features to add.

As usual, we’ll kick off in CodeBase at 19:30. That’s in Argyle House on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street. Head up to Floor L and we’ll be in the Nor' Loch room.
