### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in September will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 13th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

### *What?*

It's September, and ScotRUG is back in Edinburgh! Hopefully August brought you what you were looking for, along with a delightful splash of theatre, music, books, comedy or poetry. As the tourists drift away and the city puts on its usual lovely September display, we can start to enjoy the onset of autumn; delicious vegetables, warm sunshine and cool evenings await us. As is true at any time of year, gathering people around shared interests seems good right now. So, on that note:

This month, [Dave Jones](https://twitter.com/dvjones89) is coming to speak to us about a gem he's built. Picture the situation: you've spent time at work crafting a perfect configuration for your editor of choice. You realise there's some programming thing  you want to play with at home over the weekend, but you haven't updated your configuration at home in months. If you've ever tried to copy settings you've careful crafted on one computer to another, you'll recognize the problems here. Do you email them to yourself? Commit them to a version control system you have access to in both places? Ah, but how do you configure your access to the version control system?

Dave decided that he wanted an easier way and a better way, so he built it. His solution may help you, and may also be the inspiration you need to write a tool to solve a problem you've been having. Seems good all around no?

As usual, we'll supply some snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner. CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly group of people, and you're welcome along whether it's your first time or you're a repeated visitor. We look forward to seeing you there!
