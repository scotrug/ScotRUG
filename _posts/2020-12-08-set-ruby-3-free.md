title: Set Ruby 3 Free
---

### *Where and When?*
On the 10th December (the second Thursday of the month), we'll be meeting online for the final time in 2020. We'll start the meeting at 18:00. The link will be sent out on Wednesday via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/mljltlybcqbnb). So, sign up there!

## *What?*
So, 2020 is coming to a close. Rather than dwell on it, let us instead look forward to the consant gift of the season for Rubyists: a new Ruby version. Since we talked about Truffle Ruby last month, we figured it was reasonable to turn the spotlight back onto CRuby. This release should be a big one: version 3 is planned to be released on or around Christmas day. It's been almost 8 years [since Ruby 2.0.0-p0 was released](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/), bringing with it refinements and a change in the default encoding of Ruby scripts to UTF-8. So, what does Ruby 3 promise us?

We have no speaker this week, instead we'll wander through the release together and discuss what it turns up.
