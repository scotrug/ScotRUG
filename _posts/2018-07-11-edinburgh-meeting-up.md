### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in July will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 12th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

What a summer we're having. July is usually one of the two rainest months in Edinburgh, and instead we've been treated to sunshine, warm weather and pleasent weekends along with the usual influx of people. There's also plenty going on: the Jazz and Blues Festival is kicking off shortly, the summer festivals have released their programmes (including [Turing Fest](https://www.turingfest.com/), and further afield, sporsts are happening. Wimbledon is ramping up to Finals weekend, the Tour de France is spinning through Brittany and there's some Football World Cup stuff going on too. What a collection of things to watch!

This month, we're back to basics. The thing that sustains any meetup is, well meeting up. It's the people that make the community, so lets gather as people have as long as we've been able to communicate. What are you working on? Have you encountered problems you'd like to talk about? Did you hear about something new you'd like to share, or ask if others have experience of? Are there things you'd like ScotRUG to do or be? Awesome! Bring your ideas!

As usual, we'll supply some snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner, probably with some seasonal berries. CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly group of people, and you're welcome along whether it's your first time or one time of many. We look forward to seeing you there!
