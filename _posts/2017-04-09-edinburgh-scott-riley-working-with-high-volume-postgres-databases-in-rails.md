---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in April will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 13th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

April in Edinburgh is a glorious month. The <a href="https://www.sciencefestival.co.uk/">Science Festival</a> is on, joined with the traditional first burst of warmth in the year and the arrival of spring food. What a great time for new experiences and for experimentation.

Scott Riley works at <a href="https://cultivatehq.com">Cultivate</a>, and is coming to give us a talk about working with high volume Postgres databases in Rails. Working in web frameworks that ship with Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) like Active Record can sometimes blunt our appreciation for what's going on at the storage layer. Here's an opportunity to sharpen up our understanding of the interaction, also to think about what we might need to change when the volume is turned up.

We'll supply some snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner, and CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly bunch of humans and newcomers are most welcome!
