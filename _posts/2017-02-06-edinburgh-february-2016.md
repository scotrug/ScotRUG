### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in January will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 9th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors outside reception.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

February is an odd month. Spiced breads and weirdly hollow chocolate can be sensed at the end of the month, but the uncertain transition towards spring is at its messiest early on. The ghost of January is passed, when we met and talked about all manner of things. Paul put [together a summary](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/scotrug/CSUwT5Oh5aI/ZgXOu2aSAAAJ) if you'd like a flavour.

Something that had come up at a previous meeting but wasn't discussed in January is the subject of test doubles. What are they? What different flavours are there? When should you use them? Does it even matter?

At RubyConf in November, [Noel Rappin](http://www.noelrappin.com/) gave a talk on this subject. So we're going to show the talk, and then discuss it afterwards. Of course, this will also be a time to talk about anything else you'd like.

In a change to the regular occurrence, there will be some snacks. I think CodeBase also has water available, but feel free to bring along your own juice or water. As always, we're a friendly bunch and newcomers as well as folk who have been before would be most welcome. See you on Thursday!
