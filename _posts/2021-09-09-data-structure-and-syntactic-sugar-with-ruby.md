title: Data structure and syntactic sugar with Ruby
---

## *Where and When?*
Online! We will meet exactly a month after we moved out of the level system. Have you been out there in the wild more often as a result? Your ScotRUG organiser had a recent day out and things have been mostly fine. As mentioned last month, ScotRUG will continue to be online for the next handful of months.
As usual, it's the second Thursday of the month at 18:00. Time to have a wee break if you're working, meet your virtual friends . So: that's the 12th of March at 18:00. Since we're meeting virtually, we'll send out the link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-Xwgucjde/events/mljltlyccmbmb/) closer to the time.


## *What?*
I am glad you ask! We will be talking about Data Structure. How do they (most common) work under the hood conceptually and why you would use one over the other. How we use them in Ruby and we will see some nice syntactic sugar to access data from those data structure.

The good thing when we talk about data structure is, you don't have to be an expert with a specific language, we will talk about the general idea behind them and see how they work in Ruby. If this sounds like s come along and learn together.
