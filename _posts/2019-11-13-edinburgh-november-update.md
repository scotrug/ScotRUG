## *What Is This Update All About?*
Well, I'm glad you asked. Sadly, our scheduled speaker Will has become unexpectedly unavailable at the last minute. That means we don't have a talk about metaprogramming to bring you. But never fear! ScotRUG is always here for you. Instead we're bringing you a talk by Kevin Jacoby (ScotRUG co-organizer) on building tooling for irb/pry/the console, with specific gems and interesting examples. So, pop along at 18:00 to CodeBase, and we'll see you there!
