title: Edinburgh, 19th May 2016 - Code Kata, Code Dojo Style
---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in May will kick off in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> at an all new time of 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">Argyle House on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street.</a>

There will be a blackboard up in reception with these details too. Take the lift to 'L', and we'll meet in the area around the lifts; the room itself is through a locked door. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll
come and get you!

### *What?*
This month, we're going to be running a <a href="http://codekata.com/">coding kata</a>. A kata is a small contained problem, designed to be easy to understand. The idea is that you can experiment with new approaches over short periods of time.

We'll be using a style common to <a href="http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?WhatIsCodingDojo">code dojos</a>. Which is to say we'll work through the same small problem in pairs. Each pair will work on the problem for 20 minutes, then take a break, then switch partners. After three rotations, we'll finish up by talking about and (optionally) presenting the different developed
solutions.
