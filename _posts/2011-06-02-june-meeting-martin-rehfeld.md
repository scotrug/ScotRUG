title: Edinburgh June Meeting - Martin Rehfeld from Berlin RUG
---

The June meeting is going to be a bit special - the first in a new European Speaker Exchange Programme masterminded by the [Berlin Ruby User Group](http://www.rug-b.de/). Martin Rehfeld will be talking about the lessons learned developing his new service [Assets.io](http://www.assets.io) featuring dynamic Javascript and CSS delivery through the Amazon Cloudfront CDN. Other parts include a custom backend using evented Ruby code (Thin/Async Rack/Eventmachine). It promises to be an exciting meeting, and in due course we’ll be catapulting one of our own speakers over the North Sea to Berlin. Martin will be in Edinburgh from June 14 to June 17, so let’s all make him welcome.

We will be at the usual place, [The Edinburgh Training Centre](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&q=EH1+1SU&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&z=15) on Thursday 16 June.

The speaker exchange programme is looking for some sponsorship, particularly to cover Martin’s cost. If your company can help, get in touch via the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/usergroup-speaker-exchange) or email paul \[{at}\] edgecase.com.
