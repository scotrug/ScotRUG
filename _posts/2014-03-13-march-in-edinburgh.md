This month, we'll take a look at some solutions people have come up with for the use case below. Those who wish to can implement all or some of this use case and we'll discuss the approaches, styles and share suggestions.

The use case is from the paper [Avatars of TDD](http://blogs.agilefaqs.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/avatars-of-tdd.pdf).

__Use Case__

Design a Veterinary Information System for a Clinic. Veterinary medical system is very similar to human medical system with one exception, all the patients are animals. Each patient is owned by a person, who brings the patient to the clinic and pays the bills.

The person in charge for IT department of the clinic gave us the following Use Cases to start development.
Dave Atkins brings his pet named Fluffy into the clinic for a routine check up and shots. The veterinarian charges him for the routine office visit and the Rabies vaccination. Dave pays cash before he leaves and is provided with a receipt for the services.
