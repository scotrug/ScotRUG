We're going to learn something about cryptography by doing some Metasano Crypto Challenges in Ruby from [http://cryptopals.com/](http://cryptopals.com/).

No knowledge of cryptography is needed.

We had a go at some of these in January and people liked it. So we're going to do some again.

Interested? Just turn up! It would be nice if you signed up on our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/221212356/), though.
