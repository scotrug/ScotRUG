---

### *Where and When?*

Our final Edinburgh meeting of the year will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 13th of December at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

Another year draws to a close. Natural light is now a fleeting thing, but the nights make up for it with decorations, subtle sparkles and gigantic spinning neon rides on Princes Street.

Come Christmas, the Ruby core team will deliver us a lovely present: a new Ruby release! If you're counting, this year's [will be 2.6](https://medium.com/tailor-tech/whats-new-in-ruby-2-6-a4774f3631c1). So it's probably worth having a look around the Ruby world at what's happening. James will kick off the meet up with a few points on the current state of Ruby, from [pulling the Standard Library into gems](https://stdgems.org/), to Sorbet's type checking. Then we can talk about whatever we like! So, whether you are brand new to Ruby, or you have something you're interested in exploring, come along and let's have a chat.

CodeBase has water available from their kitchen, or feel free to bring your own drinks or snacks. We're a friendly group of people, and you're welcome along whether it's your first time or one time of many. We look forward to seeing you there!
