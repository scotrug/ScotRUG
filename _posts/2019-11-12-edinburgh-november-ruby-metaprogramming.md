---

### *Where and When?*
This November, we will be back in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 14th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

## *What?*
The cold breeze tell us one thing, Winter is here. Still, it's a good time to be in Edinburgh. The Christmas market is almost there, with delicious confort food to make this winter feels a little bit warmer.

Last month we have been looking at JRuby and how it compares to MRI Ruby. This month Will, Software Engineer at FreeAgent, will walk you through metaprogramming in ruby!

Ever wondered what was this obscure force allowing your code to write itself ? Ruby is a great language for Metaprogramming, you probably have used metaprogramming without knowing it. For example when you delegate a method call to a different object using delegate in rails or if you have used the ruby Forwardable module. But don't worry, if this is completely new to you, no need to be alarmed! It is easier than you think to get started with Metaprogramming and Will is there to demonstrate just that!

ScotRUG welcomes first timers and regular attendees, whether you're new to the language or not. We'd love to see you there!
