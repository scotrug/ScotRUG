 Get your monthly fix of Ruby help, advice and chat on **Thursday 7 April** at
 **18:30** in the [**CCA Saramago Café**](http://www.cca-glasgow.com/saramago-caf/saramago-caf-bar)!

We’ll be drinking [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org) in deference to
tradition, but there will also be teas, cold drinks and vegan pizzas available
from the bar. Imitation Postits and Sharpies to scribble down discussion topics
will be provided by the organizer.

If you want to get in touch with David (the “organizer”) for any reason at all,
you can do so on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kotoshenya), [Meetup][] or by
[email](mailto:david@djones.eu?subject=ScotRUG April Glasgow Meetup). There are
more details and maps on the [Meetup][] and
[OpenTechCalendar](https://opentechcalendar.co.uk/event/3617-glasgow-ruby-group)
event pages.
