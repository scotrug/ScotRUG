**Update:** due to absentmindedness I have only just learned that there is an
exhibition on tonight at the CCA, so we will **not** get the usual table at the
downstairs café. The meetup is going ahead, and I will try to get a corner of
the upstairs bar (also part of the Saramago), but if that is also busy we may
need to move to a nearby pub or café.

I’m so sorry! Especially if you have decided to come along based solely on the
vegan pizza which I foolishly promised.

If you are coming to the meetup and haven’t yet RSVP’d, please
[send me a quick email](mailto:david@djones.eu?subject=I am coming to the April ScotRUG Meetup)
or [tweet me](https://twitter.com/kotoshenya) so I can send out any last minute updates.
