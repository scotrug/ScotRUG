---

### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in December will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 8th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">Codebase's shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

December is upon us! Edinburgh is a city ablaze with lights at night, the smell of wood cabins crowded in Princes Street gardens compliments the noise of the crowds. Around St Andrew's Square, an ice rink for young and old, where experienced skaters help the less experienced, and folk come together. Meanwhile, preperations for various numbers of mid-winter celebrations continue, bringing together communities.

This month, we're lucky to have <a href="https://twitter.com/Gwmngilfen">Greg Sutcliffe</a> coming to speak. Greg is the community lead for <a href="https://theforeman.org/">The Foreman project</a>, RedHat's open source server management tool written in Ruby. He's going to speak about his experience learning from and working with the Foreman community.
