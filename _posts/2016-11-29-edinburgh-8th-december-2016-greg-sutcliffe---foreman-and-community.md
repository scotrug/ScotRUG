title: Edinburgh, 8th December 2016 - Greg Sutcliffe, Foreman and Community
---

### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in December will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 8th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">Codebase's shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

December is upon us! Edinburgh is a city ablaze with lights at night, the smell of wood cabins crowded in Princes Street gardens compliments the noise of the crowds. Around St Andrew's Square there's an ice rink for young and old, where experienced skaters help the less experienced, and folk come together. Meanwhile preparations for various numbers of mid-winter celebrations continue, gathering together communities.

In the monthly bringing together of the Ruby community in Edinburgh, we're lucky to have <a href="https://twitter.com/Gwmngilfen">Greg Sutcliffe</a> coming to speak. Greg is the community lead for <a href="https://theforeman.org/">The Foreman project</a>, RedHat's open source server management tool written in Ruby. Greg started out as a Foreman user, using it as a day to day tool to get server management done. His participation within Foreman eventually led him to being hired by RedHat. Fostering community is a challenge, and is an important part of building software, and I'm looking forward to what he has to say.

They'll be time for questions afterwards, and we'll likely decamp somewhere close to CodeBase for food when the meetup finishes. See some of you there? Excellent.
