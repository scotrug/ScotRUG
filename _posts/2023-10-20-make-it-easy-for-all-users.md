title: Make it easy for all users
---

### *Where and When?*

Thursday 9th November 2023, 18:00 - 19:30

### *What*

Every website should aim to make it easy for all users to find, consume or 
purchase what they are looking for, be that information, entertainment or 
products.

The aim of every web developer therefore should be to remove friction and 
make the usersâ€™ experience as pleasant as possible.

This is a user-centered talk about usability, accessibility, and 
information architecture. It will cover some solutions to common problems 
but its main objective is to provide food for thought and be a 
conversation starter.
