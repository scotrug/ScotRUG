title: Edinburgh, 13th February 2020 - No ScotRUG this month (COVID-19)
---


Hi everyone,
This is March already and the sun finally starts to shine again! If we only had good news, everything would be perfect, but... with Corona Virus getting closer and closer to Edinburgh, things may become a bit less enjoyable. In the spirit of keeping everyone safe and avoid spreading the virus, ScotRUG won't be happening this week.
Fear Not! Ruby will still be there the next time we meet (whenever that may be)! Maybe a fully remote meetup next time ?

Take care of yourselves and the people around you, don't forget the [NHS COVID-19 information](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/coronavirus-covid-19/) and let's try our best to not spread the virus.


We will see you soon!
