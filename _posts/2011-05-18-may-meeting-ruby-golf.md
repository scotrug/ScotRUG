title: Edinburgh May Meeting - Ruby Golf
---

Ruby Golf is going the rounds of a few user groups. During the Edinburgh May meeting, we will jump on the band wagon for a 9-hole round. The aim will be to complete the 9 hole course, laid out in RSpec, in as few characters as possible.

If you can’t bring a laptop, don’t worry we’ll be working in teams.

We will be at the usual place, [The Edinburgh Training Centre](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&q=EH1+1SU&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&z=15) on Thursday 19 May.
