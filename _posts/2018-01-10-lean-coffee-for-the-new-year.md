---

### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in January will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 12th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

It's 2018! The millenium bug(s) that were largely successfully dealt with would now be of legal drinking age! January is a strange month, both promising renewal and reflection and softening you up for the harsh February weather. ScotRUG this month is here to help you through. This month we have no speaker, so will instead engage in our January tradition of Lean Coffee.

[Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) is a way of generating topics to talk about, without requiring that you a) know anyone or b) be the biggest personality in the room. If there's a topic you've wanted to chat about from user experience research to new Christmas release of Ruby 2.5, this seems like a good time. We'll supply sticky notes and some kind of writing material, you bring the ideas. As per usual, snacks will be supplied to pull you through to dinner. We're looking forward to seeing some of you there!
