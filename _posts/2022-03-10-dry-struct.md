title: Dry Struct - A dry-rb ruby library
---

### *Where and When?*
Oh well, time has been flying, and it's that time of the month again. The sunshine is back in Edinburgh, we get to have longer days and that makes everyone _just_ a tad happier!
Once again we'll meet online. It'll be Thursday 10th March, at 18:00. We'll be using Google Meet for this meetup. We'll send out the link via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/284099967), so sign up there!

## *What?*
This month we will explore Dry Struct!
To quote dry-rb website: dry-rb is a collection of next-generation Ruby libraries. You might be familiar with it if you have been using [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/). We will explore the code for [dry-struct](https://dry-rb.org/gems/dry-struct/1.0/) together, so be ready to dive into some actual ruby code this week !

See you tonight !
J & K
