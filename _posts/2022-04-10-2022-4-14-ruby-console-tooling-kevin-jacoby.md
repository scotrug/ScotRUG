title: Ruby console tooling - Kevin Jacoby
---

## *Where and When?*
We're still running things online. Though most legal restrictions required by gathering in person have been removed in Scotland (keep those masks on though), the rates of infection are the highest they have ever been. Since we have folk who are at elevated risk, as well as people distributed across the country, it seems sensible to keep the online meetings going until we're more comfortable.

As usual, we'll meet on the second Thursday of the month at 18:00: April 14th. Since we're meeting virtually, we'll send out the link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/284849824/) closer to the time.

## *What*
Kevin Jacoby is going to be presenting some Ruby console tooling you can use to make your console app look great!

He says: "If you want a fancy looking table or to add some colours to your text, there are plenty of gems that can help you do this. We will have a look at some of these gems and then try them out in our own (dummy) console app."
