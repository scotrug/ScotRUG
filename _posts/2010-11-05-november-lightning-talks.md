To cheer the dismal November days, come along to ScotRUG at 19:00 on Thursday November 18 to be heartened by cheery lightning talks at the at the usual place: [Edinburgh Training Centre](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&q=EH1+1SU&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&z=15), 16 St. Marys Street, EH1 1SU.

We have:

-   [Mark Connell](http://twitter.com/mconnell) who will delight us with tales of websockets (with Ruby). You’ll laugh. You’ll cry. You’ll receive push notifications of events.
-   [Sam Elliot](http://twitter.com/lenary) on Chrome Extensions
-   Morgan Prior will be answering questions on The Ruby Mendicant University, a free online school open to anyone looking to improve their Ruby craftsmanship.

Who else would like to tell us something interesting? This month, talks can be up to 15 minutes long. Let us know on [The Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/scotrug).
