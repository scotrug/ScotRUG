title: Visual Storytelling with Noah Gibbs
---

## *Where and When?*
We'll meet on the second Thursday of the month at 18:00: August 11th. Since we're meeting virtually, we'll send out the link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-xwgucjde/events/ncvxtsydclbpb/) closer to the time.

## *What*
Most slides are horribly bad. They’re boring and they’re alienating. They’re awful to see and awful to make. They can be much better when you realise a slide presentation is a slow-motion comic. Let me teach you about visual storytelling. We’ll un-suck some bad slides from the internet without spending a ton of time.
