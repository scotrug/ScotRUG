title: Edinburgh 11th May 2017 - The World is Full of Questions
---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in May will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 11th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

This far into spring brings plenty of interest. The weather has provided a warm glow, the rattle and hum of barbeques being fired up for the first time. Birds perch in trees, having thoroughly practiced their material. In the city, TradFest has been and gone and the smell of summer is on the horizon. In the Ruby world, RailsConf also took place a few weeks ago, and the videos have [started to appear](http://confreaks.tv/events/railsconf2017). Another web framework, [Hanami](http://hanamirb.org), has gone 1.0.

So there's plenty to talk about. To help facilitate talking in and around Ruby, we're going to run it [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) style to talk about whatever comes up! Lean Coffee is a way of generating topics to talk about, without requiring that you a) know anyone or b) be the biggest personality in the room. If there's a topic you've been wanting to discuss in a less formal setting, bring it along! We'll supply sticky notes and pens and we can go from there.

There will be a modest supply of snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner, and CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly bunch of humans and newcomers are most welcome!
