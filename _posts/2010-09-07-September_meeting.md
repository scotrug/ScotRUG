title: September meeting
---

By popular demand the next meeting will be an interactive session on [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/). Bring your laptops for some fun coding. Kickoff will be at 19:30 with a walkthrough. Then we will pair up and code through some more. We will have a debrief at the end followed (no doubt) by a visit to the Holyrood Tavern.

See you at [The Edinburgh Training Centre](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&q=EH1+1SU&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&z=15) on Thursday 16 September.
