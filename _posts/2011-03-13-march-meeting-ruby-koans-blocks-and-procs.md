title: March Meeting - Ruby Koans concentrating on blocks
---

As promised, the March meeting will be another Ruby Koans session; this time we will be concentrating on blocks. Bring your laptops if you can, and it would be helpful to have downloaded the Koans and are ready to start. The Ruby Koans website is [here](http://rubykoans.com/)

If you can’t bring a laptop, don’t worry we’ll be pairing.

We will be at the usual place, [The Edinburgh Training Centre](http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?client=safari&q=EH1+1SU&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF8&hl=en&hq=&hnear=Edinburgh+EH1+1SU,+United+Kingdom&z=15) on Thursday 17 March.
