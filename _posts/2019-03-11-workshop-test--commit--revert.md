title: Edinburgh, 14th March - Workshop on test && commit || revert
---


### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in March will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 14th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

## *What?*
The Wee Dub Festival brought raggae and soundsystem culture to the capital at the start of the March, and at the end, you can wrap yourself up in yarn to keep warm at the Yarn festival. Yes, things are looking up, and a time change is coming. March, in all of its mild, cold, windy, sunny and rainy glory is here for us.

A few months ago, Kent Beck suggested a programming flow excercise that he dubbed ["test && commit || revert"](https://medium.com/@kentbeck_7670/test-commit-revert-870bbd756864). Kent is known as one of the originators of [Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), and enjoys experimenting with programming flow.

So this evening, we'll run a wee workshop and experiment with test && commit || revert. At the end, we can compare notes. What do we like? What don't we like? What would we try differently next time? Come along with a computer (or indeed be willing to pair up) and we can toy around with some Ruby code.

As always, CodeBase has water available from their kitchen to keep you hydrated. We're a friendly bunch of humans and if it's your first time or your fourth year coming along, you'll be most welcome! See you there then? Smashing.
