title: Edinburgh, 13th October 2016 - Hacktober Night
---

### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in October will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">Codebase's shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>. The old entrance on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street is no longer in use, so head around to the other side of the building where you'll find the glass doors emblazoned with "Codebase", and a glorious view of the castle.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

October has arrived, and with it, the soft early autumn fades away. The balance of day/night is tilting firmly to night, and though we haven't reached <a href="https://beltane.org/about-samhuinn/">Samhuinn</a> yet, the spirit of community pervades things. In that spirit, this month's meetup will be a hack night. Come out, meet some Ruby folk, and work on some personal projects.

Feel free to bring along something you're stuck on, something you want to get started with, or something you want to show off! There will be people around willing to help out, or happy to fawn over your latest creation. See you there!
