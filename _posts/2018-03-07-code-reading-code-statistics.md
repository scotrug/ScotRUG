title: Edinburgh, 8 March - Code Reading, Code Statistics
---

### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in March will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 8th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. This month the receptionist won't be present, so please wait for a few minutes to see if someone will come out to let you in! If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

After snow storms, sunshine. Meterological spring is finally here, though there's still heavy snow on the Pentlands and in higher portions of Edinburgh. However, the spring warmth of sunshine can be felt during the days (through windows naturally). However, I was certainly inside more than outside over the last week, curled up in the evening reading a book.

Reading is what we're going to be doing this month! Reading someone else's code can be a very valuable way of learning things. In the past we've read OpenStruct source, [learning a good few things along the way](https://cultivatehq.com/posts/lessons-from-reading-ostructrb/). Saron Yitbarak [presented on this at RailsConf a few years back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW_xKGUKLpk), and that presentation is worth a watch.

We'll take a similar approach to that this month, looking over a small code file to understand how it's working. The plan is to look at the code that powers the [Rails `stats` command](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/simple-test-metrics-in-your-rails-app-and-what-they).

We'll supply some snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner, and stave off the cold. CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly bunch of people and newcomers are most welcome! See you there? Great!
