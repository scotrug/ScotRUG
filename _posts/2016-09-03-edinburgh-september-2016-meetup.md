title: Edinburgh, 8th September 2016 - Koderunr

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in September will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> at the totally normal time of 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">Codebase's shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>. The entrance on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street is no longer in use, so head around to the other side of the building where you'll find the glass doors emblazoned with "Codebase", and a glorious view of the castle.

The room for the meeting hasn't been confirmed yet. However, there will be folk in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*
When you first approach a new programming language, be it Ruby, JavaScript or Elm, one of the quickest ways to get a feeling for it is to quickly fire up an interactive console and play around. Getting there can be awkward, since you have to install the language tools first. Well, [Jingkai He](https://twitter.com/Jaxihe) has been working on a way to fix that. He's going to talk us through [Koderunr](https://github.com/jaxi/koderunr), a project of his that allows you to send and write programs in different languages, either via a web page or via a console, without having to install the language tools yourself.

There will be plenty of time for questions afterwards! We look forward to seeing you all, first-timers or regulars, on Thursday.
