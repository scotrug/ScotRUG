title: Edinburgh, 13th February 2020 - Thinking With Grids
---

### *Where and When?*
It's February, and we'll be meeting up in <a href="https://freeagent.com">FreeAgent</a> on Thursday the 13th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/1947292751">their Edinburgh offices on Fountainbridge</a>.

There will be someone at reception to let you up to FreeAgent's offices from 17:30 until 18:00. If you arrive later than that, send an email to the mailing list or <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">send us a tweet</a>. Someone will come down for you.

## *What?*
Winter has finally set in. Whirling snow in high speed wind gusts form blizzards and coat the Pentlands. Ten minutes later the snow shines underneath blue skies.

Another thing that's changed, albeit much more slowly, has been CSS. Eric Meyer's first CSS book from O'Reilly dealt comprehensively with the topic of the then version 2.1 CSS (before we introduced CSS levels). The current edition is the same depth as the two previous editions [stacked on top of each other](https://meyerweb.com/pix/2017/csstdg-stacked.jpg).

Along the way, many things have become easier such as rounded borders and box shadows, and we've unlocked much more powerful positioning tools. The most recent of which is Grid. Grid unlocks the ability for us to create previously very difficult designs. [Jen Simmons](https://jensimmons.com/), an old hand at CSS works at Mozilla and last year gave a great talk, live editing a page using CSS grid. So, we're going to watch that, and have a chat about it afterwards.

ScotRUG welcomes first timers and regular attendees, whether you're new to the group or not. As you can see, we also do Ruby adjacent things. So, come along! We'd love to see you there!
