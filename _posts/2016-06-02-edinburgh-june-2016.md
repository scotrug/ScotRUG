title: Edinburgh, 9th June 2016 - RailsConf 2016 Talks
---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in June will kick off in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> at our new(ish) time of 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">Codebase's shiny redeveloped building on Castle Terrace</a>. The entrance on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street is no longer in use, so head around to the other side of the building where you'll find the glass doors emblazoned with "Codebase". This is the new entrance!

Our room hasn't been confirmed yet, but we'll update the site with details when we know for sure. However, there will be folk in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*
<a href="http://railsconf.com/">RailsConf</a> rolled into Kansas City in May for three days of chatting Rails and Ruby. Kansas is a fair way from Edinburgh, so to mark the occasion we'll show a 30 minute talk from the last day of the conference. Picking up a thread from last month, this is all about unpacking the magic of building a testing framework, from the creator of <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest">MiniTest</a>, <a href="http://www.zenspider.com/">Ryan Davis</a> (the framework we used last month). This sounds intimidating at first, but getting the basics together is surprisingly understandable.

General chat and presumably more specific testing chat is sure to follow. We look forward to seeing you there! If it's your first time coming along, we'd love to see you! We're a friendly bunch with lots of different levels of experience and backgrounds.
