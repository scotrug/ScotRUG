title: Edinburgh 8th June 1027 - What Steve Can Teach Us
---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in May will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 8th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*
Summer is here! Well, at least summer _was_ here. We seem to been in a bit of an autumnal taster over the last few days. Nevertheless, the temperature is up, the Film Festival is on the horizon, and seasonal allergies have shown up. Both the good and the bad eh?

This month, <a href="https://twitter.com/sarcainian">James Bell</a> will be walking us through a bit of computer history, based on the experiences of a single programmer. In "What Steve Can Teach Us", he explores understanding the past, and how that can help inform the present and the future.

As usual, we'll supply some snacks to help get your stomach through to dinner. CodeBase has water available from their kitchen but feel free to bring along your own juice or water to keep you hydrated. ScotRUGgers are a friendly bunch of humans and newcomers are most welcome. Hopefully, we'll see some of you there.
