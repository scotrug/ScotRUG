---

### *Where and When?*
For our September meeting, we will be back in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 12th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

## *What?*
Summer is putting up a valiant fight, but it feels like autumn is winning. The festival season over, and we've at least had a few days of our traditionally sunnier and warmer September days. But the nights are getting cold, and round the corner comes heartier meals and leaves falling off of trees.

Have you ever wondered how Ruby actually works? You're likely running CRuby/MRI, which is largely written in C. That might sound intimidating, especially if you've actually written C before! So Kevin, your host, will lead you through how to download the Ruby 2.7 and show you how you can use existing Ruby knowledge to see how it's working. Then we can make a change to it and build your very own Ruby. Along the way, he'll talk about what new features currently exist in Ruby 2.7, and what we might look forward to when it is released.

As always, CodeBase has water available from their kitchen to keep you hydrated. We're a friendly bunch of folks and if it's your first time or your fourth year coming along, you'll be most welcome! See you there then? Wonderful.
