### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in January will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 12th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors outside reception.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

Well looky here, the days are getting longer. They are getting colder too, but let's focus on the positives. The mind is an odd thing, making days feel longer as more sunlight fills the hours. This month at the ScotRUG meetup, we're going to fill our hours by talking. We're going to run a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) style meeting, to talk about whatever comes up!

Lean Coffee is a way of generating topics to talk about, without requiring that you a) know anyone or b) be the biggest personality in the room. If there's a topic you've been wanting to discuss in a less formal setting, bring it along! We'll supply sticky notes and pens and we can go from there. We're looking forward to seeing some of you there!
