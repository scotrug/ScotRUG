When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

## *What?*
The days are getting noticeably longer and we're having bursts of incredible cold and then gusts of wind. It must be February, but the smell of spring in the air is tantalizing.

When debugging a problem with your program, the sensible thing to think is that it's usually your code that's at fault. Not the libraries you are using, and certainly not the language or compiler. Well, Alyssa Ross is coming to talk to us about what happens when think it might actually be the tool's fault after all. She currently works at FreeAgent, and this talk will help you with: what to do when Ruby tells you "You may have encountered a bug in the Ruby interpreter or extension libraries"?

As always, CodeBase has water available from their kitchen to keep you hydrated. We're a friendly bunch of humans and if it's your first time or your fourth year coming along, you'll be most welcome! See you there then? Smashing.
