### *Where and When?*

Possibly hybrid event, tbc.

Thursday, 14th December 2023, from 18:00 until 19:30

### *What*

We are in December, which only means one thing (yes, just one!) - we have had insights on what the new Ruby 
version might look like.

As a result, we will have a look at what the new version will bring, what has changed, what’s new, how does 
everyone feel about it - let’s talk !

If you are new to Ruby, this is a good introduction to get insights on how Ruby shares new version and what 
it looks like, so come along and let’s discuss all the Ruby things!

This is our last one for the year, and it will happen online with the possibility of hybrid and a pub outing 
at the end (tbc), make sure you RSVP to get the link for our virtual gathering.
