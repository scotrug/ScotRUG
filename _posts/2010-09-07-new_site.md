Iâ€™ve made a small step towards making the ScotRUG site more maintabable, and giving us a little bit of history. I have converted it to [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). It is still not very pretty, but we can work on that. The source is on GitHub [here](http://github.com/paulanthonywilson/ScotRUG). For now, if anyone wants to make it a bit nicer, please fork and send me a pull request.
