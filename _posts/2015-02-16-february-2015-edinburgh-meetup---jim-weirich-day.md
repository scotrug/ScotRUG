title: February 2015 Edinburgh Meetup - Jim Weirich Day
---

This month's Edinburgh meetup will be on 19th February - on the anniversary of [Jim Weirich's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Weirich) death. Jim lived visiting Edinburgh, generally visiting a few times a year, and we loved having him here.

At Thursday's ScotRUG we will be remembering Jim by practicing some [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com), playing some [Werewolf](http://www.werewolves.com/werewolf-game/), and hopefully a bit of Ukelele playing.

Hope to see you at the usual place, [FreeAgent Central](https://goo.gl/maps/31Sgj), 40 Torphichen Street, EH3 8JB at 19:30. You can sign up at this [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/scotrug/) group.
