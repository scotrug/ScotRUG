## *Where and When?*
 emote is still key, though we passed 1\_000\_000 Scots who've had at least their first vaccination this week. So, let's meetup again this Thursday the 11th of February at 18:00, in an online fashion. We'll be using Google Meet again this month. We'll send out the link via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-Xwgucjde/events/mljltlyccdbpb/)


## *What?*
There is snow over most of Scotland at the moment. Which, as someone who lives close to the sea, is a surprise to me. It's not that typically slushy snow either; good dry powder abounds, revealing crunching noises when you step into it. Even better than the snow is that it is no longer totally dark at 17:00 in Edinburgh - spring is coming!

February is a short month, and it seems an ideal time to go back to one of our more collaborative activities: code reading. A good few years ago we read over OpenStruct source code and after discussion learned about singleton classes, using core data classes as storage but designing your API not to leak, and other useful considerations. This month, we'll go through another Ruby library class and hopefully learn new things!

Whether it's your first time, or you're a regular attendee, we'll be glad to have you along.

See you on Thursday!
