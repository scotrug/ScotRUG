title: January Break
---

After the year that's been, it was wonderful to finish off 2020 with a meetup to talk through the new Rails 3 features from preview 2. As is often our habit, ScotRUG will be taking a break in January to recharge. But it's a good time to read up on [Ruby 3](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2020/12/25/ruby-3-0-0-released/), and perhaps also on [Rails 6.1](ihttps://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2020/12/9/Rails-6-1-0-release/), [Stimulus Reflex](https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/) and [Hotwire](https://gorails.com/episodes/hotwire-rails). There's lots going on the Ruby world right now, with [Standard](https://github.com/testdouble/standard), [Rubyfmt](https://github.com/penelopezone/rubyfmt) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/plugin-ruby) all attempting to address Ruby style choices by making those choices for you. There's the constant evolution of the Dry.rb gems, and [Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/) is heading towards a 2.0.

So, have a play and then let us know what you'd like to talk about next month! We're always open for people to present to ScotRUG. Whether it's something small or something big, something you've only just discovered, or something you built a long time ago. Take care, and we'll see you next month.
