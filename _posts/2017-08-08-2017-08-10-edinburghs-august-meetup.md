---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in August will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 10th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*
August! The rain is still here, but there is usually the backup of warmth to go with it. A place alive with people, gawping and gaping, working out how to understand a 3D space with a 2D map. In the middle of almost every night, fireworks flare over the old town, and those impossible hang-over seats that have been building up since late May are finally in use in the castle car park. Yep, the festivals are here.

What with all this clamour and well practiced performers, this month we're going to hold a more relaxed meetup. Bring along what you're working on: a problem in a tutorial you're picking through, some open source project you contribute to, or want to contribute to, or something you'd like to explore. There will be people to share with, folk who will be able to help out. Or indeed bring nothing, and we can just chat about things Ruby and Ruby adjacent.

We'll supply some snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner, and CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly bunch of humans and newcomers are most welcome!
