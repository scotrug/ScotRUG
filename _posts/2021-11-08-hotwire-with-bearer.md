title: Running on Hotwire from Bearer
---

### *Where and When?*
The second Thursday this month is the 11th of November, and we'll aim to start at our usual time of 18:00. The pandemic is still on, so we're still meeting online; next year will likely bring new experiments. Since we're meeting virtually, we'll send out a link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/mljltlyccpbpb/).


## *What?*
This year has seen the maturing of [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/), and the announcement of it being the default way to build new web applications for Rails 7. What's it actually like to work with though? Well, Elizabeth and CÃ©dric from [Bearer](https://www.bearer.sh/) are coming to talk to us about just that.

Bearer helps security teams at tech companies automatically map data flows, and identify and mitigate data security risks across their products. While Bearer's former tech stack included React, GraphQL and Rails, their current platform is built entirely with Rails and Hotwire. In this talk, they'll share why they decided to use Rails and Hotwire, some example use cases, as well as their experience so far.
