title: Truffle Ruby - What Is It, How Do You Start With It?
---

## *Where and When?*
On the 12th November (the second Thursday of the month), we'll be meeting online, as per 2020 protocols. We'll start the meeting at 18:00. The link will be sent out on Wednesday via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/mljltlybcpbqb/). So, sign up there!

## *What?*
It's been a few months since Scotland based or Scotland adjacent Rubyists got together to chat. It's been a weird year aye? As the nights draw in, Samhain passes and we brace for the cold weather to come, it's time to gather around again, have a blether and dig into some Ruby.

This month [Duncan MacGregor](https://twitter.com/aardvark179) is going to speak to us about [Truffle Ruby](https://github.com/oracle/truffleruby). As with other interpreted languages, there are a number of options for a runtime to get your Ruby code to do something. The big one is CRuby, previously known as MRI or Matz' Ruby intepretor. There's also [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org/), the limited set of [mruby](http://mruby.org/), the fun of Ruby written in Ruby from [Rubinius](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius), the once and not forgotten [Ruby Enterprise Edition](http://rubyenterpriseedition.com/) and [Maglev Ruby](https://maglev.github.io/). Truffle is the newest of these, with a focus on high performance. Knowing what's available means you can choose the most appropriate interpreter for the job you're trying to get done, and each different interpreter also helps explore new areas for the other, pushing the state of the art forward.

It should enlightening, and we'll leave plenty of time for questions. See you all there!
