title: Truffle Ruby -- What Is It, How Do You Start With It?
---

## *Where and When?*
As per 2020 protocols, we'll be meeting online. As per usual, it's the second Thursday of the month, in this case the 12th November, at 18:00. We'll send out the link the day before via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-Xwgucjde/events/mljltlybcpbqb/edit/). So, sign up there!

## *What?*
It's been a few months since Scotland based or adjacent Rubyists got together to chat. It's been a weird year aye? As the nights draw in, Samhain passes and we brace for the cold weather to come, it's time to gather back around.

This month Duncan MacGregor is going to speak to us about Truffle Ruby. As with other interpreted languages, there are a number of options for a runtime to get your Ruby code to do something. The big one is CRuby (previously known as MRI or Matz' Ruby intepretor), but there's also [JRuby](https://www.jruby.org/), the limited set of [mruby](http://mruby.org/), the fun of Ruby wrtten in Ruby from [Rubinius](https://github.com/rubinius/rubinius) and the once and not forgotten [Ruby Enterprise Edition](http://rubyenterpriseedition.com/) and [Maglev Ruby](https://maglev.github.io/). Truffle is the newest of these, with a focus on high performance.

It should enlightening, and we'll leave plenty of time for questions. See you all there!
