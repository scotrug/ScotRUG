We're going to use the [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org) format again this month to discuss Ruby topics.

We'll kick off in [CodeBase](http://www.thisiscodebase.com) at 19:30. That's in Argyle House on the corner of [West Port and Lady Lawson Street](https://goo.gl/maps/ZuPgH)

Head up to Floor L and we'll be in the Nor Loch room.
