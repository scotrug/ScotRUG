title: No Meetup This Month
---

Hey you wonderful humans! This month (November 2017), ScotRUG is taking a breather. The organisers have a clash of commitments, and so we're unable to run. If you're looking to fill your meetup needs, there are lots of other good meetups in Edinburgh. Try [OpenTechCalendar](https://opentechcalendar.co.uk/area/62-edinburgh) for a list.

We'll see you next month though, for potential social frolics on ice, as well as a talk. Right? Right! Enjoy your Novembers.
