### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in April will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 11th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. This month the receptionist won't be present, so please wait for a few minutes to see if someone will come out to let you in! If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

April showers bring, well, cloud and rain. Though it's cold right now, the promise of higher temperatures is strong, and the floral expectation for May is high. The Science Festival is in its last week, with all kinds of lectures and hands on experiments, and on the edges of it all, ScotRUG.

This month, T.J. Sheehy is going to lead a [Lean Coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) session, where everyone present has the chance to create topics to talk about and then, well, talk about them.. So, if there's something you've been mulling over, from how can we use concerns in Rails, to what ethical considerations are there when building software, bring 'em along. We look forward to seeing you there!
