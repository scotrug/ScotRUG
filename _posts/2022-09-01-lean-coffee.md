## *Where and When?*
Once again we'll meet online. It'll be Thursday 8th September, at 18:00. We'll be using Google Meet for this meetup. We'll send out the link via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-xwgucjde/events/ncvxtsydcmblb/) on the day itself. So sign up there!

## *What*
This month we will have a Lean Coffee!
Bring 3 topics (or more?) you would like to discuss and everyone will vote for their favourites. We will then start discussing about those topics starting with the most voted one.
Any topics are good topics, if you are new to ruby, that's a good opportunity to come and ask questions :-)
