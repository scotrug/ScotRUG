title: Building an autotune with Ruby and Sonic Pi
---

### *Where and When?*
Like last month, we'll be meeting up online. It'll be Thursday July the 9th, at 18:00. We'll be using Google Meet for this meetup. We'll send out the link via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/mljltlybckbmb/)

## *What?*
Hello everyone! We had a lovely summer for about 2 weeks, but it looks like our Scottish summer is now finished :crying-but-i-knew-it-would-happen-emoji:. Gladly, this doesn't stop ScotRUG to come back for another "wash your hands and stay safe at home" edition (whoop whoop!). This month, Xavier Riley, Senior Software Engineer at FreeAgent, will give a talk about building an autotune with Sonic Pi.

What is Sonic Pi ? 
> Sonic Pi is a live coding environment based on Ruby, originally designed to support both computing and music lessons in schools, developed by Sam Aaron in the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory in collaboration with Raspberry Pi Foundation.

Come along, we are always keen to meet new people :-)
See you on Thursday !
