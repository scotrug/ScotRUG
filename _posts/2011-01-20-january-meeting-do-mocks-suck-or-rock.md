The January meeting is an experiment to determine scientifically whether [Mocks suck](http://vimeo.com/16285089) or do they [rock](http://video2010.scottishrubyconference.com/show_video/2/0). This will be done with live coding using a rigid methodolgy which we will make up on the spot. Bring a laptop if you have one. Also get the codes.

Matt Wynne’s Mock friendly code is [here](https://github.com/mattwynne/tddavatar). Brian Swan’s Mock Hostile code is [here](https://github.com/bgswan/tddavatar2)
