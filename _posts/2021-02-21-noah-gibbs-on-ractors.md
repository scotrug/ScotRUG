title: Noah Gibbs on Ractors - 11th March
---

## *Where and When?*
Another lockdown edition of ScotRUG's meet ups will be heading your way this March. As usual, it's the second Thursday of the month at 18:00. Time to have a wee break if you're working, but not lean into your evenings too much. So: that's the 11th of March at 18:00. Since we're meeting virtually, we'll send out the link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-Xwgucjde/events/mljltlyccfbpb/) closer to the time


## *What?*
Spring is here! Well _some_ springs are here and others are just around the corner. March also gifts us less time in bed as the clocks go forward, but grants us those lovely long evenings. I'm already grateful for the extra light, and a whole timeshifted hour of it is something to celebrate. No we'll also experience plenty of rain and wind too, as befits the season. [RailsConf](https://railsconf.com) is coming in April too, and this year they are selling tickets again. Although it  will be remote and tickets are expensive, they should be good value. Rails 7 is coming this year, and it's possible that this will happen at the conference. Closer to home, [Euruko](https://euruko2021.org/) is also going remote this year and taking place in late May. So, there's lots to look forward tooÂ±

Speaking of which, Ruby 3 was released in December. It brought a few experimental features that the core team hope will shape their way into full solutions in the future. Those of you that attended our December meetup will remember that we spent some time with Ractors, the new concurrency primitive that brings an actor like model into Ruby core. The estimable [Noah Gibbs](https://twitter.com/codefolio) thinks they are fun, and will be talking to us all about them. So come along and learn!

Snacks and drinks are on you, with the plus side that you get to have what you want, and in your house. See you in March!
