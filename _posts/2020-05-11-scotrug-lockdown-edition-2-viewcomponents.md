title: ScotRUG Lockdown Edition (2) 14th May - ViewComponent
---

### *Where and When?*
Like last month, we'll be meeting up online. It'll be Thursday May the 14th, at 18:00. Unlike last month, we'll be using Google Meet for this meetup. It has a downside that you'll need a Google account, but an upside that it has better moderation tools. We'll send out the link via our [Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/270531994/) on the day itself. So sign up there!

## *What?*
The weather has been surprisingly good? So that's nice? I for one am finding that, although I can't be out in it much, my spirits have been lifted by so much sunshine. One of the obvious consequences of the pandemic is that our ability to meet up in person has been, uh, severely curtailed. Amongst the Ruby community for example, the beloved Brighton Ruby has postponed the in person meetup 'til next year. However, they _are_ running an excellent looking Alt conference, at a very reasonable price. You should [check it out](https://alt.brightonruby.com/).

RailsConf likewise was supposed to happen in Portland at the start of May. The hard working folk of RubyCentral (who organise the conference) and the awesome speakers worked hard to make the event happen in a new way! So, you may have noticed [RailsConf 2020: Couch edition](https://railsconf.com/) went live last week. Since we couldn't attend in person, we thought it might be nice to discuss one of the talks with other Rubyists. Therefore, on Thursday we're going to discuss ["Encapsulating Views"](https://railsconf.com/2020/video/joel-hawksley-encapsulating-views) by Joel Hawksley. You'll need to have watched it first if you want to meaningfully participate.

To sum up: watch [Encapsulating Views](https://railsconf.com/2020/video/joel-hawksley-encapsulating-views) from this years RailsConf, and then meet up with us on Google Meet on Thursday the 14th to discuss what we saw. James will moderate the discussion.

See some of you on Thursday!
