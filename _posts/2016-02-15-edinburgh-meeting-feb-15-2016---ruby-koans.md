title: Edinburgh meeting, Feb 18 2016 - Ruby Koans
---

This Thursday's Edinburgh meeting is on the eve of [Jim Weirich](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Weirich)'s anniversary. Given Jim's fondness for visiting Edinburgh, and that we haven't had a programming session for a while, we will be dedicating the evening to [Ruby Koans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Weirich).

In pairs, we will choose a section of Koans to run through. We'll discuss what we've learnt.

As the Koans haven't really been updated for a while, we will also try and identify newer (2.x +) concepts to add. Perhaps we could make these the subject of some subsequent meetings.

As usual, we’ll kick off in CodeBase at 19:30. That’s in Argyle House on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street. Head up to Floor L and we’ll be in the Nor Loch room.
