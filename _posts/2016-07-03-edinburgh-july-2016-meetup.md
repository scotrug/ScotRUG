title: Edinburgh, 14th July 2016 - Code Reading
---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in July will kick off in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> at the increasingly normal time of 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">Codebase's shiny redeveloped building on Castle Terrace</a>. The entrance on the corner of West Port and Lady Lawson Street is no longer in use, so head around to the other side of the building where you'll find the glass doors emblazoned with "Codebase". This is the new entrance!

Our room hasn't been confirmed yet, but we'll update the site with details when we know for sure. However, there will be folk in reception to meet you and guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*
A couple of years ago, we spent a meetup reading the source code of Ruby's <a href="https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/4a41a0f7d6bf01c491bd1031d7647b029e328b59/lib/ostruct.rb">OpenStruct class</a>. In our efforts to understand what was going on, we ended up learning about Singleton classes, hash references and symbol table misses. We investigated related code and played around with how we might implement the code differently. It's been a while, and the blowy winds of change make July feel like a good time to gain insight from how other folk solve problems.

We'll pick a small project via the mailing list, then spend the meetup collaboratively going over it. We look forward to seeing you there! If it's your first time coming along, we'd love to see you! We're a friendly bunch with lots of different levels of experience and backgrounds.
