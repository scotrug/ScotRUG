title: Parsing DSLs with Treetop - Mila Kirova
---

## *Where and When?*
Online! Things in Scotland will, for the first time in over a year, [move out of the Level system](https://www.gov.scot/news/scotland-to-move-beyond-level-0/) come Monday the 9th of August. However, ScotRUG will continue to be online for the next handful of months. As usual, it's the second Thursday of the month at 18:00. Time to have a wee break if you're working, but not lean into your evenings too much. So: that's the 12th of March at 18:00. Since we're meeting virtually, we'll send out the link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-Xwgucjde/events/mljltlycclbqb/) closer to the time.


## *What?*
Though it's been a while since we updated the website, we've been continually running lockdown editions of ScotRUG's meet ups. We took a summer break in July, but now with limited summer festivals spinning up all over Edinburgh, we're back! While we ScotRUG organisers are considering what meetups might look like in the near future, we're staying online for a bit.

Speaking of meetups, this month we're lucky to have Mila Kirova come to speak to us. Mila is an engineer at FreeAgent in Edinburgh, and has recently been exploring the world of [parsers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Computer_languages) in Ruby. If you'd like to know more about what parsers are, how they work, and you might be able to use them in unexpected ways, come along and learn together.
