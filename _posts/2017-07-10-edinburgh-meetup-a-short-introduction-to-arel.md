---

### *Where and When?*
Our Edinburgh meeting in July will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 13th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*
July: the odd month of the summer in Edinburgh. Usually the rainiest, the city none-the-less hums with activity in the build up to the Festival and the Fringe. There's that flurry of other festivals: Film, Magic, Jazz & Blues and the start of the Art Festivals that get underway, and the seating for the Tattoo finally gets finished up, clinging to the edge of the Castle.

This month, we have a short talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/evangeliakoleli">Eva Koleli</a>: An Introduction to Arel. Eva works at <a href="https://freeagent.com">FreeAgent</a>, and uses Rails and ActiveRecord there to interact with their database. She's had cause to jump down a level of abstraction from ActiveRecord to Arel before, and thinks we all might benefit from adding this tool to our Ruby toolbelt. After the talk, Eva will be running a workshop, providing a toy database to help you play around with Arel directly.

When all that is done, there will be plenty of time for questions and for general chat. We'll supply some snacks to help get your hunger through to dinner, and CodeBase has water available from their kitchen. We're a friendly bunch of humans and newcomers are most welcome!
