title: Merry Ruby Christmas 2021!
---

Unbeliveable, it's already December. Days are short (therefore nights are long). It is this time of the year in Scotland when the outside is dark and cold, temperature can go below 0 but that won't stop us from enjoying what the country has to offer during this festive period. Therefore, Scotrug will meet again this month! 

## *Where and When?*
The second Thursday this month is the 9th of December, and we'll aim to start at our usual time of 18:00. The pandemic is still on - beware of the new Omicron variant, so we're still meeting online; Since we're meeting virtually, we'll send out a link via our [Meetup page for the event](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-Xwgucjde/events/mljltlyccqbmb/).


## *What?*
As per usual, we are in December, which means we have had insights on what the new Ruby version might look like. As a result, we will have a look at what the new version will bring, what has changed, what's new, how does everyone feel about it - let's talk !

If you are new to Ruby, this is a good introduction to get insights on how Ruby shares new version and what it looks like, so come along and let's discuss all the Ruby things!
