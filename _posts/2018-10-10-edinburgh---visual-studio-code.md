### *Where and When?*

Our Edinburgh meeting in October will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 11th, at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors.

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

Changeable weather, diminishing light and hours jumping back and forth. October is a month of contrasts. After having an excellent talk last month on a useful programming tool written in Ruby, it makes sense for us to look at one of the many tools that help us to write Ruby.

Visual Studio Code has been around for a few years, and is very well known and used in the JavaScript world. James Bell will give a brief introduction to VS Code, how you can set it up for Ruby use and one or two of its more powerufl features.

CodeBase has water available from their kitchen, or feel free to bring your own drinks or snacks. We're a friendly group of people, and you're welcome along whether it's your first time or one time of many. We look forward to seeing you there!
