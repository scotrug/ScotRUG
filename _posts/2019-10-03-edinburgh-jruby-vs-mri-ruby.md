The 10th will be special! FreeAgent will be showing [a talk](https://inclusivedesign24.org/2019/schedule/#talk17) from [Inclusive Design 24](https://inclusivedesign24.org). The talk will start at 17:00 and you are more than welcome to come along.
ScotRUG will start at 18.00 as usual.

If you arrive early for the Inclusive Design, you can enter the building and sign in at reception, then ask to be let up to FreeAgent. For those who will just come for ScotRUG, someone will be downstairs to let you up. Otherwise contact us on twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

## *What?*
The wind is blowing, snow is forecast on the hilltops and the sun is fast disappearing. Winter is coming. Still, it's a good time to be in Edinburgh. The winter festival to look forward to, Samhuin to enjoy and the best local food. 

Last month we went over Ruby MRI, how the underlying C code looks. This week we will be looking at JRuby and how it compares to MRI Ruby. There is a great talk from Charles Nutter and Thomas Enebo which we will be watching. Let's see where that brings us!
ScotRUG welcomes first timers and regular attendees, whether you're new to the language or not. We'd love to see you there!
