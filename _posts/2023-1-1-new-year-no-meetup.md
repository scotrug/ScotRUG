title: Happy New Year! No Meetup in January
---

Why hello there! Welcome to 2023: new year, new Ruby version. 2022 was a great year for the Ruby ecosystem: 
a major new version of an interesting web framework ([Hanami](https://hanamirb.org/blog/2022/11/22/announcing-hanami-200/) ),
the release of [a Ruby version](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2022/12/25/ruby-3-2-0-released/ that's bringing performance improvements
and Web Assembly support, [version 1.0 of Bridgetown.rb](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/release/reaching-1.0-next-generation-progressive-site-generator/),
a [new view framework](https://www.phlex.fun/), the [continuing rise of Mastodon](https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2022/04/twitter-buyout-puts-mastodon-into-spotlight/) 
and the return of awesome in person conferences.

Not to mention all the other amazing work that the community continues to do - from meetup groups like us to podcasts, blog posts and efforts to help
even more people join the community via [First Ruby Friend](https://firstrubyfriend.org/). 

With all that going on, there's plenty to read up on. As per usual, ScotRUG is going to take a break from Meetups over January while we 
settle into the new year. See you on the first Thursday in February!
