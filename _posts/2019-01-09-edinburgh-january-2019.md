### *Where and When?*

Our first Edinburgh meeting of the year will be in <a href="http://www.thisiscodebase.com/">CodeBase</a> on Thursday the 10th of January at 18:00. That's in <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/node/2622756843#map=18/55.94652/-3.20081&layers=C">their shiny building on Castle Terrace</a>.

You'll know you're in the right place as "CodeBase" is written across the glass doors. Be careful here! "Code Clan" are right next door, but that's not where we are!

When you arrive there will be someone in reception who can guide you to the right place. If you arrive late and no one is around contact us on Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/scotrug">@scotrug</a>, or send an email to the list. We'll come and get you!

### *What?*

2019! Ruby 2.6! RailsConf Call for Proposals is open! I mean. Goodness. The days are getting lighter, though they will certainly get colder. What I'm saying is: there's stuff going on.

This time of year can be a little slow as the year ramps up. To reflect this, it'll be a gentle meetup tomorrow. James will work through a live example of getting Stimulus.js set up on a new Rails 5 project, and we can work through it together.

CodeBase has water available from their kitchen, or feel free to bring your own drinks or snacks. We're a friendly group of people, and you're welcome along whether it's your first time or one time of many. We look forward to seeing you there!
