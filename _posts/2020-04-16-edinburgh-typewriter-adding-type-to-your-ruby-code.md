title: Edinburgh, 16th April 2020 - Typewriter, Adding types to your Ruby code for greater safety
---

## *Where and When?*
It's April, and we'll be meeting up online on Thursday the 16th, at 18:00.

## *What?*
Spring is almost there! But it doesn't mean that we can wander around. We still want to care for others and stay at home in those unprecedent times. For this reason, ScotRUG is going to happen this month, but online! (Whoop Whoop!)

Our speaker this month Will Mathewson, Software Engineer at FreeAgent, will give a talk on how you can add types to your ruby code, making it safer and more reliable.

To join us, all you need is a device with internet access. We will all meet together [via Skype]("https://join.skype.com/ab7rQrus83VL") which allows us to be 30 people at the same time. Should be enough right ?

See you all virtually on Thursday!

Kevin
