Ryan MacGillivray will give a quick lightning talk about using Postgres with Rails. After that we're going to do some exercises from [exercism.io](http://exercism.io).

Come along and bring your laptop!

It would be nice if you signed up on our [Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/scotrug/events/221832959/), though.
